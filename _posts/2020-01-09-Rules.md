# Overviews
Splitting business rules away for the traffic flow of data has become commonplace in all development in the last few years. It has a lot of advantages as it crystallizes the rules for an object into a simple definable, readable and most of all testable item. 

## Testable
By concentrating the rules into a object it eliminates the need to have a data set in a certain way within a datastore, and then have to go through the procedure and resetting once your done. The developer can simply write a testcase which instantiates the object and load it with with data set in a certain way, and check the reult of the rules.

![EIP Pattern](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/Kf-GaryNewport/Kf-GaryNewport.github.io/master/assets/Patterns/Rules.puml)

## Participants
The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

* IRule– Defines the interface for all specific rules.
* IRuleResult– Defines the interface for the results of all specific rules.
* BaseRule– The base class provides basic functionality to all rules that inherit from it.
* Rule– The class represents a concrete implementation of the BaseRule class.
* RulesChain– It is a helper class that contains the main rule for the current conditional statement and the rest of the conditional chain of rules.
* RulesEvaluator– This is the main class that supports the creation of readable rules and their relation. It evaluates the rules and returns their results.
