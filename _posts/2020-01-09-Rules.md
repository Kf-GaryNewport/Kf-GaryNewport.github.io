# Overviews
Splitting business rules away for the traffic flow of data has become commonplace in all development in the last few years. It has a lot of advantages as it crystallizes the rules for an object into a simple definable, readable and most of all testable item. 

## Testable
By concentrating the rules into a object it eliminates the need to have a data set in a certain way within a datastore, and then have to go through the procedure and resetting once your done. The developer can simply write a testcase which instantiates the object and load it with with data set in a certain way, and check the reult of the rules.
